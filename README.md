A standalone GUI based on FerrumX

# Download
You can download pre-built binaries from [Github Releases](https://github.com/Egg-03/FerrumX-GUI/releases)

Downloads contain an unsigned executable wrapped with Launch4j and a Runnable JAR with binaries. You can use either one. Since the executable is unsigned, your antivirus may flag it as a threat. If you don't trust the executable, use the runnable jar file.

A Java Runtime Environment is required to run the application. If you don't have one installed, you may get it from here:
https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?package=jre&os=windows

> *As of now, the repository's release page is the only official source for downloading the application. If you have downloaded it from any other sources, it is recommended to execrise caution while executing the application. The application does not need to be run in elevated mode. If any distribution asks for elevated privileges, deny it immediately and delete the application.*
